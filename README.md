    The telephone company Telzir, specialized in national long distance calls, will place
a new product on the market called FaleMais.  With Telzir's new FaleMais product, the customer purchases a plan and can talk for free up to
a certain amount of time (in minutes) and you only pay for the excess minutes. the extra minutes
has a 10% surcharge on the normal minute rate. Telzir, concerned with transparency with its customers, wants to provide a
web page where the customer can calculate the call value. There, the customer can choose the
origin and destination city codes, the connection time in minutes and choose which
SpeakMore plan. The system should show two values: (1) the value of the connection with the plan and (2)
without the plan.
