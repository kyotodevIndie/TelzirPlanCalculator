### Challenge
<br>
  <p>
    The telephone company Telzir, specialized in national long distance calls, will place
a new product on the market called FaleMais. 
  <br><br>
    Normally a Telzir customer can make a call from one city to another by paying a
fixed rate per minute, with the price being pre-defined in a list with the DDD codes of
Origin and destiny:
  <br><br>

  <br><br>
 With Telzir's new FaleMais product, the customer purchases a plan and can talk for free up to
a certain amount of time (in minutes) and you only pay for the excess minutes. the extra minutes
has a 10% surcharge on the normal minute rate. Plans are FaleMais 30 (30
minutes), FaleMais 60 (60 minutes) and FaleMais 120 (120 minutes).
  <br><br>
Telzir, concerned with transparency with its customers, wants to provide a
web page where the customer can calculate the call value. There, the customer can choose the
origin and destination city codes, the connection time in minutes and choose which
SpeakMore plan. The system should show two values: (1) the value of the connection with the plan and (2)
without the plan. The initial cost of acquiring the plan should be disregarded for this problem.
